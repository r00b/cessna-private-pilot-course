* 60 with flaps best glide speed
  * with maximum
* Read 91/103 NWRAFT
* Oil: 5 min, 8 max
* Ashless dispersant 20W50
* Max allowable mag drop: 125
* Seatbelt required
  * Takeoff
  * Landing
  * Movement on the surface
* When required to wear shoulder harness:
  * When seated with seatbelt as long as it doesn't interfere
* Approaching aircraft head on: each pilot should alter course to the right
* Ident call -> no required response
  * "Here comes the flash"
* Minimum safe altitude over non-congested areas: 500 feet above surface
  * FAR
* Congested area: 1000 feet above highest obstacle within a 2000 foot radius
* GT Aviation minimum: 700 feet AGL
* Nav lights need to be on sunset to sunrise
* Strobes on runway and while airborne
* Class B
  * Two-way radio
  * ATC clearance
  * Transponder Mode C
* Minimum reserve fuel for Day VFR
  * FAA: must have enough fuel to fly to intended location and then 30 min after under normal operation procedure
  * GT: must land with at least 1 hour of fuel
* Student pilot privileges/limitations
  * FAR Part 61.89
  * GT: Runway at least 3000 feet
* VFR cloud clearance requirements
  * 500 below
  * 1000 above
  * 2000 either side
  * Depending on airspace you are in
* Basic VFR
  * Ceiling better than 1000
  * Visibility better than 3nm
* Marginal VFR
  * Ceiling greater than 1000 less than 3000
  * Visbility greater than 3nm less than 5nm
* Ceiling is the base of the lowest layer of broken or overcast clouds
  * Not scattered
  * Few -> Scattered -> Broken -> Overcast
* Mode-C Transponder
  * Altitude and squawk
  * Above 10000 MSL excluding 2500 AGL
  * Class B and C airspaces
* Aircraft in distress has right of way over everything
* Pressure altitude: standard altitude
* Density altitude: standard altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature
* VFR cruising altitude standard West is even plus 500
* VFR cruising altitude standard East is odd plus 500
* 17500 is maximum VFR altitude because class A starts at 18000 which is IFR only
* GT short field landing standard speed: 60 KIAS
* Cram smoothly throttle, climb, and configure
* "Cleared into the Bravo" - magic words to enter Bravo
* No FRZ flight plan
  * Must land and file on ground
* Ammeter: measure current out of the battery


* Density altitude:

`[(OAT - ISA) * 120] + PA = DA`

* OAT: outside air temperature
* ISA: international standard atmosphere (15°C at sea level, -2°C every 1,000 feet increase in altitude)
* PA: pressure altitude
