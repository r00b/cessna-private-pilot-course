### 5 issues with checklists

1. Forgetting to do the checklist
  * Fixes
    * Operational procedures
    * Flows and correlation
    * Blue card, brief, checklist
    * Callouts/altitude reminders
2. Finding the right time to read the checklist
  * Fixes
    * Timing - find appropriate time to run checklist
    * Slow down (speedwise, or take the long way)
    * Allocate duties
3. Taking too long to complete the checklist
  * Too many items on checklists, items on checklist that don't need to be on checklist, not ordered from most important to least important
  * Too much read-do
  * Lose place in checklist
  * Fixes
    * Flows
4. Minimize interruptions
  * Distraction that causes you to lose your place
  * Fixes
    * Start from beginning if you make mistake, get interrupted, or lose place
5. CRM/SRM: Know which checklist you're reading, when it starts and when it ends
  * Fixes
    * Clearly communicate which checklist running, when it starts, and when it ends
    * Also known as a callout

### Callouts
* Before-start check (not checklist) and before-start check complete
* Names (see list)
* 1000 feet

### Briefs
* Pre-takeoff, pre-arrival

### Ground Lesson
* GT Aviation Safety Procedures
* Fuel reserve FAA: destination plus 30 min thereafter under normal cruise consumption
  * Night: 45 min
* GT aviation fuel reserve: all flights must land with 1 hour of fuel reserve based on normal consumption (about 8 gallons)
* VFR weather minimums
  * FAA: Ceilings greater 3000, visibility of 5 miles
  * GT: See memory items
* Minimum safe altitudes
  * FAA
    * Unpopulated: 500 feet above surface
    * Populated: 1000 feet above highest obstacle within a 2000 foot radius
    * Maintain altitude at which of powerplant failure must make safe landing without damaging person or property
  * GT Aviation
    * No flying under 700 feet AGL except for takeoff and landing
    * Simulated emergency landings terminate at no lower than 500 AGL
* 0-179 degrees (Eastbound) Odd + 500 ft: ex 3,500 5,500 7,500
* 180-359 degrees (Westbound) Even + 500 ft: ex 4,500 6,500 ,8,500
* VFR ends at 18,000 Class A
* FAA Solo Limitations
  * 3sm during day, 5sm at night
  * Memorize the rest
  * Learn GT bullets from GT student handbook notes

(a) A student pilot may not act as pilot in command of an aircraft:
(1) That is carrying a passenger;
(2) That is carrying property for compensation or hire;
(3) For compensation or hire;
(4) In furtherance of a business;

(6) With a flight or surface visibility of less than 3 statute miles during daylight hours or 5 statute miles at night;
(7) When the flight cannot be made with visual reference to the surface; or
(8) In a manner contrary to any limitations placed in the pilot's logbook by an authorized instructor.
