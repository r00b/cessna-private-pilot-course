## III. Hazards

### Wake Turbulence Avoidance
* Wake turbulence occurs any time an airplane is flying
* High pressure air circulates from area of high pressure beneath the wing upward and around wingtip to fill low pressure area on top of the wing
* Creates a vortex

[Wing vortices](images/vortex.png)

* Strongest when airplane is at high AOA, slow speed, heavy weight, and clean configuration (since all require higher AOA)
* Vortices occur whenever there is lift and sink behind the airplane at a rate of several hundred feet per minute
  * Slow rate of descent and strength over time
  * Spread outward on ground at rate of 2-3 knots
  * Drift with the wind (hazardous when light quarting tailwind blows upwind vortext back over the runway)

[Crosswind vortices](images/crosswind-vortices.png)

* Avoid wake turbulence by noting where departing aircraft rotated; try to lift off before that aircraft's rotation point
  * Turn away from aircraft's departure path, preferably upwind, to avoid vortices
* Note where landing aircraft lowers nose wheel to runway
  * Allow time for dissipation
  * Allow time if light quartering tailwind is present
  * Plan to become airbone after the landing aircraft's nose wheel touchdown point
* Stay at or above large aircraft's fligth path when in flight to avoid vortices
* When landing, note large aircraft's nose wheel touchdown point, and plan to touch down beyond that point
* Allow two minutes of separation

### Wind Shear Awareness and Recovery Procedures
* Wind shear is any sudden change in wind speed or direction
* Can occur at all altitudes and both horizontally and vertically
* Most frequent causes are thunderstorms, fronts, low-altitude temperaturer inversions, or obstructions
  * Thunderstorms are worst (vertical speeds of 6,000 fpm)
* Wind changing from headwind to decreasing headwing or a tailwind will decrease airspeed and pitch (and vice versa)
  * Either may indicate a microburst
* Generally, in a microburst, you will have first a strong increase in headwind, followed by a strong downdraft then a rapidly increasing tailwind
* At first sign of microburst, apply full power and go-around
* Frontal wind shear
  * Stronger when temperature difference of two air masses is greater
* Low-altitude temperature inversions
  * Cold, calm air is at surface and warmer air is in motion above the cold air
  * Can cause chaing in airspeed of 25 knots or more when climbing or descending through inversion boundary
  * Be aware of winds aloft; compare with surface winds and respond promptly to airspeed changes

![Inversion](images/inversion.png)

* Obstructions
  * Disrupt normal airflow
  * Produce varying wind directions and velocities
  * Compensate for known wind shear by carrying additional airspeed if runway length permits; or, land on different runway or divert to another airport

![Obstructions](images/obstructions.png)

  * **F**ly the airplane
  * **A**ssess the situation
  * **D**ecide what to do
  * **D**o it
* Know emergency checklists, and memorize boldface items
* Land as soon as possible: field
* Land as soon as practical: airport
* Radios
  * Transmit on current frequency if already talking with someone
  * 121.5 MHz otherwise, the international emergency frequency which is monitored by many government agencies and other aircraft

### Basic Engine Failure Procedures
* ABC: Airspeed for best glide, Best field selected, Cockpit checks
  * **A**ttitude/airspeed for best glide speed
    * Use attitude, not airspeed, and don't fixate on the panel
  * **B**est field selected
    * Start looking for best area for emergency landing
    * A field is generally within gliding distance if it is not moving higher on the windshield
    * Don't pass up a good landing area to get to a better one
    * Best if it's upwind
    * Runway is best
    * Fields generally better than roads
      * Use caution for tall crops, soft conditions (following rain)
      * Land parallel to furrows if field is furrowed
    * Roads which are smooth; watch for traffic, wires, and poles
    * Dry lake beds and beaches, which are best just landward of the waterline
  * **C**ockpit checks performed (floor to door)
    * Perform checklist memory items for Engine Failure During Flight (Restart Procedures) checklist
      * Don't rush
    * Follow up with remaining checklist items if time
    * Apply carb heat before exhaust has a chance to cool down (prevent icing)
    * Fuel starvation is one of most common causes of engine failure
      * Turn on auxiliary fuel pump
      * Ensure fuel selector on both, or switch tanks
      * Ensure fuel shutoff valve is on "on"

### Emergency Equipment and Survival Gear
* Familiarize yourself with emergency equipment and procedures and checklists in Section 3 and systems and equipment in Section 7 of POH/AFM
* Important to be as familiar with emergency checklists/operations as much as possible
  * Checklist from memory and then confirm later

#### Planning for an Emergency
* Be familiar with weather and terrain along route
* Carrying emergency equipment appropriate to flight environment
  * First aid kit
  * Food and drink
  * Emergency banana
  * Flotation devices for overwater flights beyond gliding distance to shore
* Wear appropriate clothing for environment (departure, destination, and en route)
  * Closed-toed shoes
  * Long pants (fire protection)
  * Natural fabrics (fire protection)
* Always file a flight plan
* Review installed emergency equipment as noted in POH
* Be familiar with operation of major systems in the airplane (GPS, electrical, powerplant, fuel)
* Be familiar with performance of airplane for current conditions
  * Carb icing
  * Glide distance for proposed altitude
  * Climb performance, crosswind limitations

#### Ballistic Recovery System (for the Cessna SkyCatcher as an add-on)
* Rocket deployed parachute that recovers aircraft and occupants, lowering it to the ground at safe rate of descent
* Stowed and mounted in baggage compartment and attaches to airplane primary structure upon deployment
  * Rocket motor mounted aft or parachute canister
* Designed for use when pilot is no longer able to fly airplane safely or airplane is no longer controllable
* Deployment
  * Remove protective cover from activation handle box
  * Pull on handle with at least 40 lbs of force

#### Off-Airport Forced Landing
* Immediate concer should be caring for injuries, avoiding hypothermia (too cold) or hyperthermia (too hot), and having enough water
* Stay with your airplane
  * ELT will be focus of rescue operations
  * Aircraft can be used as shelter, source of fuel to start a fire (small quantity of gasoline), and means for communicating with rescuers (via VHF radio)
