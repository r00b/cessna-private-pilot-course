## I. Learning About Your Airplane

### Why an Airplane Flies Straight-and-Level
* An airplane is inherently stable about the lateral axis, known as longitudinal stability (or pitch stability)
* When airplane nose is disturbed by turbulence or accidental bump in controls, airplane will oscillate a couple times and then return to original airspeed and altitude as air flow over horizontal stabilizer forces aircraft to correct
* Positive static stability: initial tendency of nose to come back up
* Positive dynamic stability: initial tendency over time for oscillations to correct
* Positive static stability is required for positive dynamic stability
* Neutral static stability: airplane tends to stay where it is displaced to
* Negative static stability: airplane tends to continue in the direction it is being displaced
* Cessnas have positive static and dynamic stability
* Longitudinal (pitch) stability is determined by center of gravity (CG) compared to the location of center of lift (CL)
* Cessnas have CG forward of CL, making them stable

![CG/CL](images/CGCL.png)

* Aircraft is more stable the more forward the CG is compared to the CL
* More forward CG is compared to CL, more downward force required on tail, and more stable the aircraft
* If CG is too rearward, nose will not return to original attitude when disturbed
  * Difficult or impossible to recover from stall
* Aerodynamic downward force on tail means nose will pitch up when power is increased and vice versa
* Airflow over the horizontal stabilizer and elevator creates a form of lift, but in the opposite direction, pushing the tail down to balance the aircraft (increased airflow from increasing power thus pushes tail down and nose up, causing a climb)
  * Think of tail and upside-down wing
  * Opposite applies when removing power
* More airflow &#8594; more tail downforce &#8594; more forward pressure needed on control stick to keep nose level and counteract tail downforce
* Less airflow &#8594; less tail downforce &#8594; more back pressure needed on control stick to keep nose level and add tail downforce

#### Center of Gravity Range
* Manufacturer sets a forward and aft limit on the location of CG
* Found in POH Section 6
* CG moves when any weight distribution within the aircraft changes (fuel, passengers, baggage)
* Further aft the CG &#8594; more tail heavy &#8594; more forward pressure necessary
  * Aircraft becomes negatively stable
  * Lower nose &#8594; keeps going down
  * Raise nose &#8594; keeps going up
* Further forward the CG &#8594; more nose heavy &#8594; more back pressure necessary
  * Aircraft will become increasingly difficult to maneuver
  * Forward-of-limits CG will make takeoff rotation nearly impossible

### Comparing the Instruments to the View Outside
* Look outside as much as possible
  * See position relative to horizon and avoid traffic
  * Instrument panel should be looked at briefly to confirm what is seen outside
* Attitude indicator
  * Marked in 5° increments on mechanical indicators
  * Marked in 2.5° increments on electronic indicators
  * Bank relative to horizon marked in 10° increments for first 30° of bank
  * In a G1000-equipped airplane, slip/skid indicator is in attitude indicator as bar under horizon marks
  * "Step on the ball"

### Learning About Heading
* Heading is the direction the airplane is pointed in relation to magnetic north
* *Magnetic* north (Earth's magnetic field), not *true* north
* Headings are expressed in degrees clockwise from magnetic north
  * North is 0° but more commonly 360°
  * East is 90°
  * South is 180°
  * West is 270°
* When expressing heading, pronounce all three digits
  * 10° &#8594; zero one zero degrees
  * 120° &#8594; one two zero degrees
* A **heading indicator** is gyroscopically stabilized to avoid the errors in the magnetic compass that occur when you are turning or accelerating/decelerating
* Match heading indicator to compass when not turning, accelerating, or decelerating
* **Must reset heading indicator about every 15 minutes**
* Electronic flight display gets heading information from remote magnetometer that is stabilized to avoid compass errors
* Heading indicators have a heading bug to set desired heading
  * Good idea for setting to runway heading to ensure on proper runway
  * Good idea for settings to direction the local winds are from during taxi
* Magnetic compass
  * Inspected annually during an aircraft's annual
  * Should be checked for proper fluid levels before each flight

### Learning About Airspeed and Altitude
* Airspeed indicator; color-coded
* White
  * Flap-operating range
* Green
  * Normal operating range
* Yellow
  * Caution range
* Red and white "barber pole"
  * Never-exceed speed
* Red
  * Low speed awareness

#### V-speeds
* V<sub>SO</sub>
  * Stall speed in landing configuration
  * Full flaps and gear down
* V<sub>S1</sub>
  * Stall speed in clean configuration
  * No flaps
* V<sub>R</sub> (shown to the right of airspeed tape in G1000)
  * Rotation speed
* V<sub>G</sub> (shown to the right of airspeed tape in G1000)
  * Best glide speed
  * Most lift with least drag
* V<sub>X</sub> (shown to the right of airspeed tape in G1000)
  * Best angle of climb
  * Most altitude for given distance (get to desired altitude in minimum distance)
* V<sub>Y</sub> (shown to the right of airspeed tape in G1000)
  * Best rate of climb
  * Most altitude for a given time (get to desired altitude in minimum time)
* V<sub>FE</sub>
  * Maximum flap extended speed for full flaps
  * Exceeding this speed with flaps extended may damage flaps or wing
* V<sub>NO</sub>
  * Maximum structural cruising speed
  * Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air and with caution
* V<sub>NE</sub>
  * Never exceed speed
  * Exceeding this speed may compromise structural integrity of the airplane

* Arcs in analog speed indicator indicate certain V speeds

![Analog V speeds](images/analog-v-speeds.png)

#### Altimeter
* In G1000, tape on right side in 20 foot increments
* Adjusted with barometric pressure knob to set local altimeter settings in barometric pressure window or airport elevation
* Mentally calculate height above ground level (AGL) by subtracting elevation of terrain from indicated altitude on altimeter
* Reading an analog altimeter
  * If a hand is between numbers, round it down to the lower number like a watch
  * Read tens-of-thousands, then thousands, then hundreds (each tick mark is 20 feet)

#### Vertical speed indicator (VSI)
  * Located to right of altitude tape in electronic flight display with 500 feet increments
  * Uses needle and 100 foot increments in analog instrument

### Learning About Slow Flight
* Slower an airplane flies &#8594; greater angle of attack and more induced drag
* Faster an airplane flies &#8594; more parasite drag

![Drag](images/drag-2.png)

* Total drag = induced drag + parasite drag
* Induced drag
  * Comes from production of lift
  * Decreases as airspeed increases
  * Increases with AOA
* Parasite drag
  * Increases as airspeed increases
  * Combination of
    * Form drag
      * Results from body of aircraft plowing through air, affected by size and shape of airplane
    * Interference drag
      * Results from vortices that form where two surfaces of airplane join at sharp edge (i.e. where wings meet fuselage)
    * Skin friction drag
      * Friction between aircraft skin and air
* Bottom of total drag requires least power and gives maximum endurance
* Area to left of bottom of curve is *region of reverse command/back side of the power required curve*
  * More power needed to fly slower and slower
  * Speed is unstable (negative static stability)
  * Slow flight

#### Slow Flight
* Less air over control surfaces
* Combination of pitch and power to control
* **Pitch controls airspeed in slow flight**
* **Power controls altitude in slow flight**
* Both are directly correlated (i.e. higher pitch to slow down, more power to climb, etc)
* Rudder and trim are very necessary in slow flight

#### Procedure
* Reduce power to 1900 RPM
* Add back pressure to maintain altitude
* Nose up trim to relieve control pressure
* Add power when slightly above target airspeed of 50-55 knots
* Increase power to maintain altitude, use right rudder
* Straight and level
  * Pitch to control airspeed, power to control altitude

#### Turns
* 90° to left or right
  * No more than 15° bank
  * Note landmark and initial heading; set heading bug
* Add power, more right rudder and back pressure

#### Climbs
* Note heading reference
* Apply full power and right rudder
* Pitch to maintain 55 knots, climb 200 feet, reduce power to level off

#### Descents
* Reduce power to 1500 RPM or idle
* Reduce right rudder
* Pitch to maintain 55 knots, above goal altitude by 200 feet, add power and right rudder back to original setting

#### Recovery
* Apply full power
* Increase right rudder
* Maintain altitude
* Gain airspeed
* Reduce flap settings
* Once at normal speed, reduce power back to normal cruise power setting, reduce right rudder
* Minimum controllable airspeed is speed at which stall will result if:
  * Any further increase in AOA
  * Reduction in power
* Stall warning horn may sound during slow flight, which occurs about 5-10 knots above the stall in all conditions
* Power and back pressure necessary to prevent stall when in a bank in slow flight
* Increase in bank increases stall speed
* Use shallow banks; only around 15°, no more than 30° when under 1000 feet AGL or in the traffic pattern
