* IFR not in vicinity of airport:
  * Weather reports and forecasts
  * Alternatives
  * Traffic delays
* All:
  * Distance available and required for takeoff and landing
  * Runways you intend to use
* Fuel requirements
  * Sufficient fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing; 30 minutes thereafter for day VFR and 45 minutes thereafter for night VFR
  * Better idea to have an hour of reserve
* Alternatives
  * Alternate airport for destination and consideration of suitable airports along route
* Crew members must remain at crew stations unless absence is necessary to perform required duty or physiological needs
* Passengers
  * Seat belts must be used for taxi, takeoff, and landing, but not necessarily en route
  * PIC must brief passengers on how to use them
* Crew
  * Seat belts must be used during takeoff, landing, and while en route
  * Shoulder harnesses must be used during takeoff and landing unless it will interfere with duties
* Alcohol
  * 8 hours bottle to throttle
  * BAC limit of 0.04%
  * Cannot transport someone under the influence except in emergencies

## II. Rules for Flight

### Right-of-way Rules
* Less maneuverable category aircraft gets right-of-way
* Right-of-way:
  1. Aircraft in distress always has right-of-way over all other traffic at all times
  2. Hot-air ballooon
  3. Glider (over all powered aircraft)
  4. Airship (over more maneuverable aircraft including powered parachute, weight-shift-control aircraft, airplane, rotorcraft)
  5. Aircraft towing or refueling another aircraft
  6. Helicopters and airplanes are equal to each other
* When two aircraft are converging, the aircraft on the right has right-of-way

![Converging](images/converging.png)

* When one aircraft is overtaking another, the aircraft being overtaken has right-of-way and overtaking aircraft should alter course to the right and pass overtaken aircraft on right

![Overtaking an aircraft](images/overtaking.png)

* If two aircraft approaching head on, they should alter course to the right, regardless of category

![Head-on approach](images/head-on.png)

* Aircraft on final approach to land have right-of-way over all other aircraft in flight or on the surface
* They cannot take advantage of this to force an aircraft off the runway when it has landed or trying to make way for an aircraft on final
* If two or more aircraft approaching to land, lower aircraft has right-of-way, but cannot cut in front of aircraft on final

### Collision Avoidance
* When climbing, good idea to make shallow turns or periodically lower nose to scan for traffic
* Formation flying
  * Only permitted by prearrangement
  * Prohibited if carrying passengers for hire
  * Requires training

#### Aerobatics
* Prohibited:
  * Within lateral boundaries of Class B, C, and D airspace, and Class E when it is designated for an airport
  * Below 1,500 feet AGL
  * Less than 3 miles of visibility
  * Over any populated area
  * Over any assembly of people without a waiver
* Must wear a parachute inspected within previous 180 days if any maneuver exceeds 60 degree bank or 30 degree nose-up or down attitude

#### Cruise Flight
For VFR:
* Above 3,000 feet AGL on a heading of between 360 and 179 degrees (N and E), must fly at odd altitude plus 500 feet
* 180 through 359 degrees must fly at even altitudes plus 500 feet
* ONE
  * Odd, North, East
* Provides 1000 feet separation between opposite direction VFR traffic and 500 feet separation from IFR traffic, which flies at thousand foot intervals

#### Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)
* Generally cannot fly above 400 feet AGL or in vicinity of airport without permission from tower
* Be aware of UAS that violate these rules
* UAS activity may be shown in NOTAMs or graphically on reports from 1800wxbrief

#### Near Midair Collision (NMAC) Reporting
* Possibility of collision occurs of less than 500 feet to another aircraft, or pilot states a collision hazard existed
* Report to ATC/FSS or to FSDO

### Flying at High or Low Altitude
* Atmosphere
  * Oxygen is approximately 21% of atmosphere and remains the same percentage as you climb
  * Increasing altitude decreases atmospheric pressure, causing less oxygen to get to tissues
* Supplemental oxygen is required based on cabin pressure altitudes
* Crew member rules regarding supplemental oxygen
  * Not required 12,500 feet and blow
  * Required 12,500 feet through 14,000 feet for the part of flight at this altitude that lasts longer than 30 minutes
  * Required continuously above 14,000 feet
* Passenger rules
  * Must be provided with supplemental oxygen above 15,000 feet (and must be aware of it) but not required

#### Minimum altitudes
* Must always be high enough to make an emergency landing without hazard to people or property, except during takeoff or landing
* Above congested area or assembly of people, must remain 1000 feet above highest obstacle within a 2000 foot horizontal radius of aircraft
* Above uncongested area, must remain 500 feet AGL
* Over open water or sparsely populated areas, must remain 500 feet away from any person/vessel/vehicle/structure

### Air Traffic Control and LAHSO
* FSS provides search and rescue operations
* Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC) and Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) services
  * Separation services to IFR aircraft within controlled airspace
  * VFR flight following
    * Traffic advisories **on a workload-permitting basis**
  * No guarantee of search and rescue
  * Emergency services (aircraft in distress or lost)

![ATC System](images/atc-system.png)

* ATC clearance
  * Authorization the allows you to proceed under specified conditions
  * Does not necessarily separate you from other traffic
  * Does not give you priority over other traffic
  * Must be adhered to when accepted and may be amended at your request
* Emergency
  * May do whatever is required, including deviating from clearance
  * If given priority by ATC, a full report may be requested within 48 hours

#### Land And Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)
* Simultaneous aircraft landings on intersecting runways
* Increase airport capacity and operation
* Require one landing to hold short of an intersecting runway
* Require minimum visibility of 3 statute miles

![LAHSO](images/lahso.png)

* PIC has final authority to accept or decline a LAHSO
  * Student and unfamiliar pilots should not participate
  * Should decline LAHSO clearance when it compromises safety
  * Must determine that they can safely stop within Available Landing Distance (ALD)
    * Published in Chart Supplements/U.S. Terminal Procedures
  * Should read back clearance with "hold short of ..."

## III. Rules for Reporting Accidents and Incidents

### Accident and Incident Notification
* Job of determining cause of accidents is responsibility of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
  * May delegate investigation to FAA
* 49 CFR NTSB 830
  * Require notification on operator who caused or authorized use of the aircraft involved
* Definition of an accident
  * Occurs between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until all such persons have disembarked
  * When any person suffers death or serious injury
  * Any time there is "substantial damange" to an aircraft regardless of injury
* Immediate notification to NTSB required when:
  * Aircraft is involved in an accident or for following incidents (which are not accidents):
    * Aircraft is overdue which may have been in accident
    * Crew member unabled to perform normal duties
    * Flight control system malfunction or failure
    * Fire in flight
    * Collide in flight
    * $25,000 or more in damage to property other than aircraft
* Written report required within 10 days after the event for all accidents, but only if required for incidents
* NTSB takes control of aircraft wreckage; it should not be moved
