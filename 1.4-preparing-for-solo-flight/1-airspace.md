## I. Airspace

### Basics of the Airspace System
* Organized into several classes
* Comply with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) format of airspace classification
* Depend on complexity/density of air traffic, nature of operations in airspace, level of safety required, national interests
* Two types
  * Uncontrolled airspace
    * No separation service for IFR flights
    * Less restrictive weather minimums
    * No clearance to enter, requires no communications
    * Can include airspace around an airport without an operating control tower
  * Controlled airspace
    * Provides separation service for IFR flights
    * More restrictive weather minimums
    * May require clearance to enter, communications, transponder and ADS-B Out
    * Can include airspace around an airport with an operation control tower (Class D, C, and B) or elsewhere (i.e. Class E that surrounds airport)
* Controlled airspace
  * Class A (think altitude)
    * 18,000 feet MSL through 60,000 feet MSL
    * Must be instrument rated and equipped (transponder/ADS-B) and on IFR flight plan
  * Class B
    * Surrounds airports with most airline service
    * Requires clearance to enter
    * Requires transponder and ADS-B Out
  * Class C (think congested)
    * Surrounds airports not as busy as Class B but busier than Class D
    * Requires two-way communications
    * Has radar services
    * Requires a transponder and ADS-B Out
  * Class D (think dialog)
    * Lowest level of airspace that requires communications
    * Occurs where there is a control tower and airspace is not class B or C
  * Class E (think elsewhere)
    * Controlled airspace that is not Class A, B, C, or D
    * Does not require communications
    * Class E at and above 10,000 feet MSL and 2,500 feet AGL requires a transponoder and ADS-B Out since there is no airspeed restriction under Mach 1
* More complex airspace &#8594; more IFR traffic
* Uncontrolled airspace includes Class G (go for it)
  * No communications requirements
* Class F - not used in United States, but used in Canada as military/special use airspace

![ADS-B Requirements](images/adsb.png)

### Class G Airspace
* "Go for it"
* Uncontrolled airspace
* No ATC separation service
* No mandatory communication requirements
* Less strict weather minimums
* May be used by pilots with any level of certificate
* Not directly depicted on sectionals
* Default airspace if no controlled airspace depicted
* Generally starts at surface and extends to base of Class E airspace

![Class G](images/class-g.png)

* Boundary of Class E implies boundary of Class G

![Class G boundary](images/class-g-boundary.png)

* Magenta dashed line - class G airspace does not exist at surface, common around airports with instrument approaches

![Class E surface](images/class-e-sfc.png)

* Inside fuzzy/faded side of magenta vignette, Class G airspace extends from surface up to but not including 700 feet AGL, where Class E begins

![Class G magenta vignette](images/class-g-magenta-vignette.png)

* Inside fuzzy/faded side of blue vignette, Class G extends from surface up to but not including 1,200 feet AGL, where CLass E begins
* Common around airways

![Class G blue vignette](images/class-g-blue-vignette.png)

* So, class G extends up to but not including either 700 or 1,200 feet AGL
* Can extend up to 14,500 feet MSL, where class E usually begins everywhere if it has not begun already
* Generally
  * East of Rocky Mountains: Class G tends to go up to but not including 1,200 feet AGL, where Class E starts
  * West of Rocky Mountains: some areas where class G goes up to but not including 14,500 feet MSL

### Class E Airspace
* "Elsewhere"
* Controlled airspace not designated Class A, B, C, or D
* Separation IFR service provided by ATC
* Legal for VFR flights to fly in it without talking to anyone if weather is good enough
* Does not require specific pilot certification, navigation or communications equipment (except transponder and ADS-B Out when at and above 10,000 feet MSL and above 2,500 feet AGL)
* Established in 48 states and Alaska above 14,500 feet MSL unless noted on sectional
* Class E airspace protects Federal airways, which
  * Extend 4 nautical miles or 4.5 degrees, whichever is greater, from centerline on each side
  * Begin at 1200 feet AGL unless noted on sectional
  * Extend upward to base of overlying controlled airspace
  * Centerline depicted with blue line
  * Class E airspace shown by fuzzy side of blue vignette

![Airway](images/airway.png)

* Class E airspace also protects approach area for airports with instrument traffic
* Referred to as a "transition area" for IFR aircraft
* Depicted on sectional with fuzzy side of either magenta or blue vignette
* Magenta - begins at 700 feet AGL
* Class E airspace also found in more congested areas of country in spaces between airways
* Sometimes down to the surface (surface area Class E)
  * Depicted by dashed magenta line
  * Provides separation service for IFR aircraft fown to the ground at non-towered airport with instrument approach
  * Shaped to provide airspace for instrument approach; extends upward to base of overlying controlled airspace
  * Can be used as extension of Class B, C or D surface areas
  * Not in effect at surface when ATC communications/weather reporting services unavailable (times can be found in Chart Supplement)
* In summary:
  * Dashed magenta line: Class E at surface
  * Fuzzy side of magenta vignette: Class E at 700 feet AGL
  * Fuzzy side of blue vignette: Class E at 1200 feet AGL
  * Not charted: begins at 14,500 feet MSL
* Upper limit is 17,999 feet MSL (after which class A starts)
* Class E starts again above 60,000 feet and up to space
* Basic radar service for VFR flights workload permitting

### Class D Airspace
* "Dialogue"
* Surrounds airports with operational control tower

### Weather Minimums
* Different weather requirements for controlled vs. uncontrolled airspaces
  * Most IFR operations conducted in controlled airspace
  * VFR flight in controlled airspace close to clouds and in poor visibility can present conflict with IFR flights

VFR weather requirements in controlled and uncontrolled airspaces:

![Weather minimums](images/weather-minimums.png)

* Doubling method when flying below 10,000 feet MSL
    * Start with 500 feet below clouds
    * Double for 1,000 feet above the clouds
    * Double for 2,000 feet to side of clouds
* "Ones" when flying above 10,000 feet
  * 1,000 feet below
  * 1,000 feet above
  * 1 mile from the sides
* Special situations
