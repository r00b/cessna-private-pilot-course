# I. Exploring the Airplane

### The Main Parts of the Airplane
* Cessna 172P engine produces 150-160 horsepower
* Alternator keeps batery charged
* Magnetos provide independent electrical power for the ignition system
* Two main landing gear can support the full weight of the airplane

#### Empennage
* The vertical stabilizer is **vertical** itself; doesn't stabilize the airplane *vertically*
* Same for horizontal stabilizer


### The Airplane's Flight Controls

#### Ailerons
* Moving yoke to left -> left aileron up, right aileron down -> downward force on left wing, upward force on right wing
* In a turn, a portion of vertical life is coverted to horizontal lift

#### Rudder
* Rudder controls yaw, the left and right motion of the nose
* Pushing on the **LEFT** rudder pedal moves the rudder to the left, deflecting the tail to the right, yawing the nose of the airplane to the left
* Same for **RIGHT** rudder pedal

#### Throttle
* Attached to engine via cable; pushing **IN** opens throttle and increases power, pulling **OUT** closes throttle and decreases power


# II. Getting Ready for Flight

### Ready for Flight

* **IMSAFE** checklist for physical and mental readiness
**I**llness
**M**edication - check [FAA-permitted OTC medications](https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/medical_certification/media/OTCMedicationsforPilots.pdf)
**S**tress
**A**lcohol - in the past 8, 12, 24 hours? A hangover counts as under the influence of alcohol; see [FAA Alcohol & Flying](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/safety/pilotsafetybrochures/media/alcohol.pdf) brochure
**F**atigue & **F**ood - skipped a meal?
**E**motion - recent arguments? How are you feeling?

#### Weather
* Check airport's Automated Weather Observation System (AWOS) or Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)
  * Winds, visibility, sky condition, temperature/dew point, altimeter settings
* Wind direction is direction from which wind is blowing, referenced to true north and expressed to nearest 10 degress around the compass
* Visibility measured in statue miles, 5,280 feet per mile
* Cloud base given as "above ground level" (AGL); overcast or broken --> cloud ceiling

##### Temperature
* Higher the temperature, poorer the engine will perform
* Closer the temperature and dew point, greater the chance for lower visibilities/fog

##### Pressure
* Standard atmospheric pressure is 29.92 in Hg
* Above standard -> high pressure; below standard -> low pressure

* Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC) is defined as having both a cloud ceiling higher than 3,000 feet AGL and visibility greater than 5 statue miles
* VMC with winds less than 15 knots is best for student pilots


#### Weight and Balance
* Important to compute so you do not exceed maximum weight for aircraft type and can takeoff/land safely


### Safe Habits Around Airplanes

* Look for beacon light to signal that a propeller is active
* **When moving the propeller, ensure ignition switch is OFF, key is out of ignition and in plain site, mixture controle is IDLE CUT OFF, and throttle is closed; move propeller with flat hand rather than wrapping around the blade; it is possible to start an engine by moving the propeller!**
* Clear visually and yell clear prop before starting engine
* Fire extinguisher between two front seats

### Checking the Airplane Before Flight
* Four documents you must have in the airplane:
  * **A**irworthiness certificate
  * **R**egistration certificate (good for 3 years)
  * **O**perating limitations
  * **W**eight and balance information

### Engine Start
* Throttle opened about 1/4 inch
* Red mixture control knob
  * Adjusts fuel/air mixture
  * Push forward --> richen the mixture; all the way forward is full rich
  * Pull back --> lean the mexture; all the way back is idle cutoff
  * Lock button prevents rapid/large/inadvertent movements
  * Rotate knob for vernier adjustment; clockwise is rich, counter-clockwise is lean
  * Pulled back to idle cutoff to begin engine start, pushed forward as engine catches for **fuel injected engines**
  * Full rich for engine start for engines with **carburetors**
  * General leaning --> pull 1 inch back
  * Shutdown --> Pull all the way back
* Master switch controls electrical power from main battery (not engine ignition)
* Ignition switch ignites engine
* If no oil pressure after starting engine, shut down the engine to avoid damage
* Follow checklist to start engine; idle at 1000 RPM after start; [see this page](https://cessnaflighttraining.kingschools.com/CCF/Lesson/Page?lessonId=10008&page=6) for abbreviated checklist


# III. Controlling the Airplane's Motion

### Controlling the Airplane on the Ground

#### Taxiing
* 1000 RPM (tachometer) is general power setting while on the ground
* For taxiing, rest balls of feet on the rudder pedals
* Study airport diagram before taxi, look for taxi designations/hotspots/runway crossings/parallel runways
* Record taxi clearance instructions!
* **Check brakes before taxiing!**
* Control speed with throttle, try to slow down with throttle and only brakes if necessary
* Watch wingtips
* Verbally confirm "clear, left, right, and center" when crossing intersections
* Keep heels on floor when not using brakes to avoid riding them
* Stay on centerline by putting taxi line between your two feet
* In turns, reduce power but keep the airplane moving

#### Run-Up
* Face into wind if possible
* Straighten nose wheel
* Apply parking brake
* Before Takeoff checklist

### Getting into the Air
1. Lights: turn on landing and/or taxi lights
2. Camera: Check transponder, set to 1200/assigned squawk and ALT
3. Action: Set mixture full rich

* Get clearance for takeoff
* Or when untowered, state intentions over Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF)
* Lineup and wait: taxi on the runway onto the centerline, but HOLD for takeoff clearance
* Look to make sure nobody in on approach, and verbalize "clear final"

#### Takeoff
* Taxi onto runway, line up, straighten wheel, come to complete stop
* Feet off breaks, heels on floor to keep off brakes
* Apply full throttle and keep hand on throttle
* Briefly check engine instruments (especially oil pressure) for green; proper RPM
* **ANNUNCIATE:**
  * "Takeoff" on application of full throttle
  * "Gauages green" after checking engine gauges
  * "Airspeed alive" at first airspeed indication

* Look about halfway down the runway to stay straight with slight rudder input
* Airplane may tend to veer left; apply larger amount of right rudder early in takeoff
* Gently pull back on yoke and let airplane fly itself off the runway
* Establish proper pitch attitude, just below 10 degree mark, to accelerate to
* V<sub>x</sub>: *best angle of climb, at 62 knots* to reach highest altitude in shortest distance
and
* V<sub>y</sub>: *best rate of climb, at 74 knots* to reach highest altitude in shortest time
* See [this page](https://cessnaflighttraining.kingschools.com/CCF/Lesson/Page?lessonId=10011&page=9)
* Right rudder common to compensate for left-turning tendency
* Look back and maintain centerline, especially because of parallel runways


#### After Takeoff
* After-takeoff checklist at 1000 AGL
* Lower nose slightly every 500 feet to check for other aircraft; look behind you too

#### Trim
* Before setting trim, set desired engine power (RPM) **and** desired pitch

### Straight-and-Level Flight
* Perform cruise checklist
* Start transition at about 10% of the vertical speed
  * i.e. leveling off at 500 fpm, push nose down approximately 50 feet before the altitude you want ot level off at
* Wait for speed to build up to cruise speed (around 90 knots)
* Reduce power to desired RPM (2200-2300)
* Adjust trim
* Lean the mixture

* **A**ltitude/Airspeed
  * Adjust altitude for proper airspeed
* **P**ower
  * Set power as desired
* **T**rim

* Pick point on horizon and head toward it
* Keep wings level on either side through the window
* Small corrections--use power to help you get back to where you want your altitude to be

### Turns, Climbs, and Descents

#### Pre-Maneuver checklist
* Landing light on
* Full rich
* Safe altitude (above 1500 AGL)
* Verify the area is clear

#### Turns
* Raise wing that you will be turning into first to check blind spot
* 30 degreees of bank
* Look for traffic above, below, and all around
* Clear via two 90-degree turns or one 180-degree turn
* Announce intentions on 122.75
* Report position relative to a known landmark, altitude, and intentions
* Note heading before turn and look for outside reference point
* Move yoke and apply a small amount of rudder as needed

##### Adverse yaw
* Rudder counteracts adverse yaw
* Caused by increased drag on the down aileron (induced drag, byproduct of lift); aircraft will yaw in direction opposite the turn
* Use rudder in same direction as turn to fight against adverse yaw
* Must apply back pressure since some lift is lost to horizontal lift
* **Once you have established desired bank angle, return yoke to neutral; aircraft will retain bank**
* Start taking bank out at a heading about 1/2 the bank angle *ahead* of the heading at which you want to have completely stopped turning
  * i.e. in 30° bank turn, start rolling out of the turn about 15° before the heading you want
* Use rudder in opposite direction as you roll out of the turn
* Relax back pressure on yoke

#### Climbs
* Full throttle forward
* Pitch up to climb altitude (about 10 degrees); use sight picture; *glance* at flight display
* Trim to relieve control pressures
At desired altitude...
* Ease forward on yoke
* APT
  * Wait for airspeed to rebuild (around 90 knots)
  * Set cruise power (2200-2300 RPM)
  * Trim

#### Descents
* Pull throttle to 1500 RPM or idle
* **Let** the nose pitch down (about 5°); use sign picture; *glance* at flight display
* Trim to relieve control pressures
At desired altitude...
* Ease back on yoke
* Pitch to level flight attitude
* Set cruise power (2200-2300 RPM)
* Trim

### After the Flight
* Securing Airplane/Shutdown checklist
* Turn off electrical equipment first
* Shut down engine by pulling mixture back to idle cutoff (not ignition!)

#### Pushing the aircraft
* Use a towbar
* Do not push or pull on the tail
* Can push on struts , just not horizontal/vertical surfaces
* Can push and pull on blades of propeller close to the hub
* Chock wheels, protective covers, all switches off
* Customary to leave airplane with parking brake off in case of towing

* Hobbs meter: length of time battery master is on and oil pressure exceeds 20 PSI
* Tachometer: total number of revolutions of the engine and converts them to hours (needed for maintenance tracking)
* If you do not fill fuel tanks, you run the risk of water condensation in the fuel tanks
