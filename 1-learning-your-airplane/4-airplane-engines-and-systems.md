# Airplane Engines and Systems



## I. Engine and Propeller

### How the Engine Works
* Airplane engine and propeller are the powerplant
* Reciprocating engines--back-and-forth movement of the pistons
  * Radial, in-line, v-type, or opposed cylinders
  * Liquid or air cooled
  * Cessna 172 has horizontally opposed cylinders and is air cooled

#### Main parts of the engine
* Cylinder
  * Contains intake/exhaust valves, spark plugs, and pistons
* Crankcase
  * Contains crankshaft and connecting rods
  * Crankshaft is connected to the piston through the connecting rod
* Accessory housing
  * Contains the magnetos

* Engine and propeller are direct drive

#### Four-stroke
* Intake
  * Piston moves down, sucking fuel/air mixture into cylinder
* Compression
  * Piston rises to the top of the cylinder, compressing fuel/air mixture
* Power
  * Spark plugs ignite fuel/air mixture and drive piston down
* Exhaust
  * Piston driven up and pushes out remnant gases from combustion

* Desired fuel-to-air ratio by weight is 15 parts air to 1 part avgas (15:1)
* Engine will not burn fuel properly and run smoothly if mixture is too lean or rich
* As you gain altitude, air is less dense--less molecules per unit volume of air
  * Therefore less weight
  * Engine draws air based on volume but needs the mixture to be correct by weight
  * Amount of fuel must be reduced to compensate for thinner air to get the same 15:1 mixture
* Lean mixture gives
  * Smoother engine operation
  * More power
  * Greater fuel efficiency
  * Less carbon build-up on spark plugs
* Mixture can and should be leaned when using less than 75% power above 3000 ft MSL even when full throttle or climbing
* With an EGT gauge, lean the mixture until the EGT temperature peaks, then go lean or rich of peak depending on your political opinions (/s)
  * According to ground school, go with rich of peak to 50 degrees under peak
* If no EGT, lean to maximum RPM
* Full rich should be used at high power below 3000 ft (takeoffs and climbs) and before landing for a go-around

#### Engine temperature
* Mixture directly affects engine temperature
* Richer &#8594; lower the engine temperature (excess fuel carries heat away)
* Leaner &#8594; higher the temperature (to a point)
* Airflow, however, is primary way the engine is cooled in a C172
  * Cooling fins on cylinders are heat sinks
  * Baffles in engine compartment direct airflow over the fins
  * Air enters through nose inlets, is directed around cylinders by the baffles, and leaves through bottom of cowling
  * Run ups &#8594; point nose into wind if possible
* In the air, engine cooling is primarily controlled via airspeed, power, and mixture
* Climb at higher airspeeds (lower pitch) to keep engine cool
* Cruise at low power settings

### How the Engine Gets Air and Fuel
* Carbuertor mixes fuel and air
* Fuel-injection system injects fuel into air just before entry into each cylinder
* Air enters via inlet and filter to carburetor, passes through venturi, speeds up/causing lo pressure, which pulls fuel out of opening from float chamber into the venturi
* Fuel mixes with air, controlled via butterfly throttle valve, and is then ducted to teh cylinders through manifold tubing

#### Carburetor Icing
* Carb icing is a concern due to lower temperature caused by fuel vaporization and decreased pressure in the venturi
  * Pressure decrease causes temperature decrease
  * Low pressure pulling fuel into the venturi cools air around it (like water on your skin evaporates and cools you)
  * Temperature can drop as much as 60 to 70 °F
* **Favorable conditions for carb icing include high humidity and temps beteen 20 to 70 °F (-7 to 21 °C)**

* Indications of carb icing
  * Loss of RPM as ice blocks airflow
  * Loss of manifold pressure (constant speed prop) since propeller governer keeps engine RPM constant
* Carb heat should be used at reduce power settings (follow POH)
* Exhaust system will cool quickly in event of ice-caused shutdown, might not be able to melt ice
* Carb heat ducts air around exhaust muffler and into carburetor
  * Melting ice causes loss of RPM and engine roughness for about 30 sec-several minutes
  * RPM will gradually increase
* Carb heat in normal conditions cause RPM since warmer air is less dense (less power output, unfavorable fuel-air mixture ratio)
* Never use carb heat when full power is required

#### Fuel-Injected engines
* Cessna 172SP
* Auxiliary fuel pump provides pressurized fuel to fuel/air control for starting and emergency use
* Engine driven fuel pump takes over after starting
* Fuel/air control unit replaces carburetor and meters fuel based on mixture, sending it to fuel distributor at rate controlled by throttle
* Fuel distributor distributes fuel to individual fuel discharge nozzles located at entrance of each cylinder (spider valve)
* Fuel discharge nozzles inject fuel directly into each cylinder
* Fuel pressure/flow indicator indicates flow of fuel to engine
* Benefits
  * Better fuel economy (more precise control and distribution)
  * Faster throttle response
  * Easier cold-weather starts
  * No carb ice!
* It is possible for air intake to ice (induction icing)
  * In this case, spring-loaded alternate air door opens automatically (or can be opened manually) to provide an alternate air intake route
* Drawbacks
  * May be more difficult to start when engine is hot (fuel vaprozies in distribution lines)
  * Blocks normal fuel flow, causing *vapor lock*
  * Total fuel starvation makes it hard to re-start due to air in system
