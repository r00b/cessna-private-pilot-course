## I. Using Short or Soft Runways

### Short-Field Takeoff and Landing

#### Short-Field Takeoff
* Performance section of PIM (Pilot Information Manual) has takeoff and landing distance required at various density altitude
* Good idea to add margin (~50%) to computed data to determine minimum distances
* Typically, shorter distance required for landing than takeoff
  * Might be unable to take off from an airport which you have landed!
* Short-field takeoff considerations
  * Weight: 10% increase in weight decreases performance by about 20%
  * Wind: headwind of 10% of takeoff speed will reduce ground roll by about 15%
  * Terrain: may restrict some airports to one-way operations
  * Runway slope: uphill requires more takeoff distance, downhill requires less
* Short-field takeoff technique
  * Consult PIM
  * Start with full length of runway
  * Flaps 10 degrees
  * Hold breaks until maximum thrust
  * Liftof at V<sub>R</sub>
  * Climb at V<sub>X</sub> until obstacles clear, the accelerate to V<sub>Y</sub> and retract flaps
  * Common mistakes
    * No flaps
    * Improper trim prior to takeoff
    * Premature liftoff
    * Too much forward elevator pressure

#### Short-Field Landing
* Short-field landing considerations
  * Headwind of 10% will reduce ground roll approximately 15%
  * For every 10% below maximum landing weight, final approach speed may be reduced by 5% for best performance
  * Too slow &#8594; unstable control, insufficient energy to flare
  * Too fast &#8594; floating excessively during flare, increasing landing distance
  * Terrain may restrict to one-way operations
  * Slope: uphill &#8594; less landing distance required
* Short-field landing technique
  * Consult PIM
  * Land into wind
  * Full flaps at 65 KIAS
  * Power progressively reduced and nose lowered when obstacle cleared
  * After touchdown, use brakes and retract flaps to put weight on main wheels
  * Aerodynamic braking with elevator
  * Common mistakes
    * Not allowing enough room on final and having to drop quickly
    * Unstable approach
    * Too low an airspeed, meaning inability to flare and landing hard
    * Prematurely reducing power to idle and landing hard
    * Too high of airspeed, causing you to float
    * Touching down with excessive airspeed and landing flat
    * Excessive braking
    * Failure to maintain directional control

### Soft-Field Takeoff and Landing

#### Soft-Field Takeoff
* Grass, mud, sand, rough surface
* Get weight of wheels as soon as possible
* Ensure area is safe for startup and runup; clear debris
* Taxiing with control stick full back and without stopping
* Takeoff into wind with groundspeed for liftoff as low as possible with 10Â° flaps
* Apply full power rapidly with enough back pressure to establish positive angle of attack and raise weight off nosewheel
* Keep aircraft in nose-high altitude as takeoff progresses
* Liftoff occurs at an airspeed slower than a safe climb speed but safe when in ground effect
* Gently reduce pitch attitude and accelerate in ground effect to at least V<sub>X</sub>
* Initial climb at V<sub>X</sub> and then V<sub>Y</sub>
* Soft-field takeoff may not be possible if runway is also short
* Common errors
  * Failure to clear area for other aircraft
  * Forgetting to lower flaps
  * Too much back pressure, producing drag and making it difficult to accelerate
  * Insufficient back pressure during takeoff roll resulting in nosewheel remaining on the runway
  * Allowing aircraft to settle back after liftoff
  * Not leveling off in ground effect

#### Soft-Field Landing
* Land into the wind to get slowest possible touchdown speed
* Touch down at slowest possible speed as smoothly as possible
* Protect nosewheel
* Normal approach with full flaps
* Hold aircraft off runway one to two feet above in ground effect for as long as possible with slight amount of power to reduce touchdown speed
* Touch down on main wheels, hold nosewheel off as long as possible
* Avoid using brakes since soft field will slow down the plane
* Keep aircraft moving with power; do not stop
* Do not worry about retracting flaps, focus on aircraft control
* Common errors
  * Excessive descent rate or airspeed on final approach
  * Unstablized approach
  * Rounding out too high
  * Letting nosewheel drop to runway
  * Not keeping weight of nosewheel
