### FAA Form 8710
* Application for private pilot certificate
* Form 8710-1a
* Completed and signed by instructor
* Or, use IACRA

### Airplane Logbooks
* Fixed-pitch airplanes generally have an airframe logbook and an engine logbook
* Examiner must ensure that airplane used for practical test is airworthy with all inspections up-to-date
* Mark inspections in aircraft logbook and AD compliance notes
* Be prepared to explain the required maintenance inspections and ADs
* Locate actual weight and balance for the specific aircraft in the POH (not the PIM)

### Items to Bring
* ACS
* Aircraft documents
  * Airworthiness certificate
  * Registration certificate
  * Operating limitations
* Aircraft maintenance records
  * Logbook records of inspections, airworthiness/safety directives
  * POH
* Flight navigation log for assigned cross-country flight plan
  * If not assigned a cross-country flight, select a trip and plan it
* Blank navigation logs
* Filled out flight plan for the planned cross-country flight
* Complete weather briefing printed out
* Weight and balance calculations, including examiner's weight
* Fuel needed to complete trip including reserves and alternates
* Current aeronautical charts
* Current chart supplement
* Current FAR/AIM
* E6B plotter/flight computer
* Personal records
  * Identification (photo ID)
  * Student pilot certificate
  * Medical certificate
  * Driver's license

  * Required flight experience
* Examiner's fee
* Be organized! Separate folders for airplane documents, flight planning materials, personal records

### Airman Certification Standards (ACS)
* Specific objectives a pilot candidate must meet during the oral and flight portion of the practical test
* Used by the DPE to evaluate you
* Appendices contain tips
* Used as a basis for all evaluators

## II. The Oral Exam

### Helpful Hints
* Oral must be completed before the flight portion
* Oral questioning is not restricted to the ground portion
* Can last an hour to several hours; three hours usually is sufficient
* Most practical tests are passed or failed during the oral
* All knowledge for the oral are located in the ACS
* Learn your evaluator
  * Test procedures
  * Will the evaluator let you start a maneuver over if you're not happy with how it's progressing?
  * The day's schedule (i.e. a lunch break)
* Ask evaluator if you should plan a cross-country trip
  * Where to, evaluator's weight and baggage
  * Be prepared to discuss any weight or range limitations
* Get a weather briefing as closely as possible to the exam
  * Be prepared to discuss the weather and its implications
* Arrive early!
* Don't go off on tangents when answering questions

## III. The Flight Exam

### You are the PIC
* You are PIC during the practical exam
* The evaluator is an observer and will not touch the controls unless necessary for safety
* Do not feel hurried to begin or complete a maneuver, and do not start it if you're not ready
  * You are responsible for safe conduct of the flight
* Consider narrate what you are doing
* Scan for traffic and **don't forget clearing turns**
* Areas of unsatisfactory performance:
  * DPE must take corrective intervention to maintain a safe flight
  * Failure to use proper and effective visual scanning techniques
  * Consistently exceeding the tolerances stated in the ACS objectives
  * Failure to take promp corrective action when tolerances are exceeded
* Must consistently exceed tolerances and fail to correct in order to fail
* Evaluator can make allowances for noticeable turbulence
* May be able to start the maneuver over if you have set up improperly or if the maneuver is off
* Don't forget checklists
* Organize pilot for good SRM
* Always clear area before maneuvers
* Be familiar with local airport operations and traffic patterns (tab Chart Supplement for the airport)
