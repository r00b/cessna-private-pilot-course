# Stalls, Takeoffs, and Landings Explained

## I. Normal and Crosswind Takeoffs and Landings

### Takeoffs
* CHORRD checklist
* **C**onditions
  * i.e. crosswind
* **H**azards
  * i.e. wind causing issues with directional control
* **O**perational changes
  * i.e. taking off with aileron full right, gradually decreasing; i.e. delay lit-off to have better control
* **R**unway required vs. available
  * i.e. required today is 850 feet ground roll, 1250 feet takeoff distance, with 3400 feet runway available
* **R**return Procedure
  * i.e. if we have problems after takeoff I will enter downwind and return to this airport
* **D**eparture plans
  * i.e. runway heading until above pattern altitude and then climb to 3000 feet MSL on heading of 030
* Before taking the runway
  * Lights: landing light on
  * Camera: transponder set ALT
  * Action: mixture full rich, clear final
* When ready
  * Taxi onto runway, set crosswind correction, select reference for tracking centerline, start roll
  * Smoothly apply full power (three seconds)
  * Apply right rudder pressure to counteract left-turning tendency
  * Glance at engine indicators to ensure normal operation
  * Establish aircraft in climb attitude
  * Let airplane fly itself off the runway (around V<sub>R</sub>)
  * Pitch for V<sub>Y</sub>
    * Verify climb attitude of just below the 10-degree mark on attitude indicator
  * Keep right rudder in, after establishing safe climb, verify coordinated
  * Retract flaps once at safe altitude (at least 200 AGL and 60 knots)
  * Look out back window to verify no drift from runway
* Crosswind takeoffs
  * Use aileron control into the wind
    * Wind from right &#8594; yoke to right
    * Wind from left &#8594; yoke to left
    * Should be fully deflected at takeoff roll
      * Raised aileron will keep wing from being lifted by wind; lowered aileron will increase drag and prevent airplane from weathervaning into the wind
      * Not enough aileron will let upwind wing rise and cause airplane to "skip", imposing side-stresses on the landing gear
  * Gradually reduce aileron control as you gain speed
  * Use rudder to keep nose straight
* Significant crosswind
  * Keep main wheels on ground slightly longer than normal takeoff
  * Both main wheels should lift off at same time, but ok to lift downwind wheel to prevent side-skipping
* Compensate for additional left-turning tendency with more right rudder
* Hints
  * Keep toes off brakes by keeping heels on floor and balls of feet on bottom of rudder pedals
  * Maintain full power to enhance performance my providing more fuel (and thus cooling) to engine until clear of obstacles/high enough to level-off
* After takeoff
  * Correcting for wind, looking for traffic, retracting flaps, lowering nose every 500 feet to get better look for traffic ahead
  * Climb checklist at 1000 feet AGL, transition to cruise climb airspeed/shallower climb

### Landings
6 phases:
* Downwind, abeam the point of intended landing
* Base leg
* Roundout (lare)
* Touchdown
* After-landing roll

#### Downwind / abeam the point of landing
* Reduce power
* Apply carb heat
* Start descent (80-85 knots)
* Lower flaps

#### Base Leg
* Start turn at 45° angle from point of intended landing
* Set flaps to next increment setting (20°)
* Reduce airspeed
* Point where you turn depends on wind
  * Strong wind &#8594; base leg closer to runway
  * Light wind &#8594; base leg further from runway
* Typically will have crosswind, should establish crab to correct for drift
* Flap setting and rate of descent will be on wind/distance from runway threshold
* Airspeed on base should be approximately 1.4 V<sub>SO</sub> (75 knots in C172)
* Check final for traffic

#### Final approach
* Normal bank angle to turn from base leg to final approach
* Line up with centerline
* Tailwind on base &#8594; turn slightly early
* Headwind on base &#8594; turn slightly late
* Add more flaps as needed
* Airpseed should be about 1.3 V<sub>SO</sub> (65 knots in C172)
* Touch down in first third of runway
* Maintain proper angle of descent/airspeed by coordinating power and pitch
* Stablized final approach &#8594; half-mile out you have proper angle of descent, altitude, airspeed, and power setting
* Keep touchdown aiming point at same position on windscreen
  * Moves down on windscreen &#8594; pitch down and reduce power
  * Moves up on windscreen &#8594; pitch up and increase power
* Descent rate of 300 feet per nautical mile is normal

![Descent rate](images/descent-rate.png)

* 3 miles &#8594; 1000 feet
* 1 mile &#8594; 300 feet
* .5 mile &#8594; 150 feet
* .25 model &#8594; 75 feet

#### Roundout (flare)
* Start 10 to 20 feet from ground by easing back pressure
* Gradual increase in pitch, AOA, and decrease in airspeed
* Keep lined up with centerline; use aileron to move towards centerline and rudder to keep aircraft body parallel with runway
* Visual focus same distance as car
* Touchdown should occur beyond the aim point (because of roundout) but within first third of runway

#### Touchdown

![Touchdown](images/touchdown.png)

* Nose-high/tail-low attitude
* On both main wheels, except crosswind where upwind main wheel will touch first
* At or near V<sub>SO</sub>
* On the centerline wiht longitudinal axis parallel to runway
* With no sideways drift (keep aileron correction after touchdown and increase during landing roll)

#### After-landing roll
* Ends when aircraft reaches taxi speed or stops
* Confirm throddle at idle
* Back pressure on elevator to minimize stress on nose gear (after nose gear has settled)
* Gradual increase of aileron input into wind (if crosswind)
* Rudder pressure to keep nose straight
* Apply brake pressure evenly as necessary
* Exit runway when slow enough to safely make turn onto taxiway
* Tell controller "unable" if unable to safely make taxiway

* Runway slope may create illusions of being too high or low
* Runway width may also create same illusions
